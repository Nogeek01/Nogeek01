- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Nogeek01
I came across this site and need help. I still run windows 7 successfully 
Somehow after midnight yesterday it installed a new Net frame version - how can that be?
I now have a NET.FRAME installed that is for later window versions and crashed everything
MS does not allow me to install an earlier version, as this is the latest one 4.8.03761
Can access safe mode with internet
any suggestions please? 
I tried repair from CD but do not want to use restart from last backup as the backupdate is 
exactly the one when the net file was installed, there are no other backup dates available.
thx
